# OneLedger Case Study 


## Overview and Origin 

Blockchain technology is a revolutionary and innovative concept that uses distributed ledgers, cryptography, and smart contracts to deliver secure, high-quality products that will change the perspective of how online services perform. However, the single aspect we know is yet to come, an old-fashioned blockchain is a game-changer for how the internet operates.

Global data is increasing rapidly; therefore, privacy and security are challenging to maintain, especially in the finance sector, where they are most needed. Financial technology, known as Fintech, companies are here to solve these challenges by applying blockchain technologies to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services.

### About the Company
OneLedger was founded in 2017 and is located in Toronto, Canada. David Cao is the Founder of OneLedger, who has over three years of blockchain experience and over 10 years of enterprise architect experience. He worked at IBM Toronto Lab on the development of DB2 and WebSphere Commerce core engine. As a specialist in supply chain, payments, and e-commerce, David has helped large enterprises grow exponentially, including Home Depot, Sears, and Toshiba. David is an active member of both the Hyperledger and blockchain community.

Edwin Zhang is the Co-founder and Managing Director of OneLedger. He is a veteran in the blockchain startup and investment space, and a former Software Engineering Lead spearheading blockchain-related R&D for TribalScale - an innovation firm specializing in emerging technologies. Edwin has a vast technical background as both a blockchain developer, with Solidity and Ethereum smart contract development experience, and software developer. He brings to the table extensive investment experience backed by a technical foundation and a wide global reach within the cryptocurrency community.

Funds were raised with over eight companies investors, like Coinbar, Signal Ventures, LCG Ventures, and Blockground Capital, who all believed in OneLedger. Recently, Coinex joined OneLedger investors whom all have disclosed investment funds.

Currently, blockchains exist as isolated networks introducing two major restrictions, among others the idea of Oneledger came to life to deliver solution

No practical way to transfer value directly between different blockchains. Today, if we want to transfer digital assets 'across' chains, we have to do so by transferring the assets to intermediary centralized exchanges, using their in-house wallets and ledgers to swap assets, and then transferring the new assets to their corresponding blockchains. This process is, of course, time-consuming, costly, and involves substantial third-party risks. Cross-chain atomic swaps, where digital assets can be moved across different blockchains without the need to trust a third-party, are being worked on, but are still far from being ready for widespread adoption.
Inability of businesses and individuals to easily deploy distributed applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain platforms. Today, to deploy dApps across multiple platforms, developers need to write smart contracts in multiple languages, depending on each platform of choice. This is, again, expensive, resource-intensive, and time-consuming, thereby making dApps practically infeasible and largely ineffective for businesses.
These two major restrictions need to be tackled. OneLedger has taken a uniquely interesting route to making blockchains interoperable, and here, OneLedger (OLT) is a platform that helps businesses adapt to blockchain technology in a fast and simplified manner. For enterprises, developers, and investors, OneLedger provides a true universal protocol that provides a one-stop solution for enterprise blockchain applications in the form of modules. The smart contract built on the OneLedger Protocol is a true cross-chain smart contract. The OneLedger plans to create a platform where multiple blockchains can interact with each other through the platform's chain.


## Business Activities

As blockchain technologies continue to evolve, OneLedger’s expertise in implementing blockchain in advisory banks, trade and the L/C system create opportunities to grow businesses by overcoming the industry’s significant challenges.

How does a letter of credit work?

![Business activity ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23088451/220787800-d381aa42-ebe3-44e6-8733-9be162e10285.png)



Trade is transactions between trading parties in different countries, with the flow of goods and documents separated. In particular, Letter of Credit, the economic guarantee from a creditworthy bank to an exporter of goods, plays a vital role in settling trade payments.

##### Current letter of credit system challenges:

However, disputes arise due to delays in delivering goods, processing bills, receiving goods, and inconsistencies of the relevant documents.

Trading parties and international organisations have gone to great lengths to address these problems. In particular, bank intervention as a broker of transactions has helped solve trade-related issues. Still, the resulting increase in transaction costs, complex procedures, and paper-based trading practices can hinder trade development. This is because paper documents are bulky in the process. For example, it takes more than five business days to deliver paper documents.
Other raised issue is that If the exporter presents documents that do not meet the conditions of the letter of credit, the payment cannot be collected. The importer has a limitation that the quality of the goods is not guaranteed even if the documents match.
Credit risk arising from trade transactions and the cost of complicated procedures are factors that increase barriers to entry into international trade.

The solution to these challenges
Letter of credit using blockchain will bring to businesses: transaction-related costs can be significantly reduced because they are not subject to central control and resolve obstacles to current L/C transactions and prevent fraud.
Letter of credit and all data can store on all parties networks, which can’t be tampered with and verified simultaneously: immutability.
L/C will be created as NFT on Smart contract and when there is a new transaction, parties certify the transaction in real-time: security and confidentiality.
Exporters can monitor the importer's L/C application process on the blockchain. Therefore, the possibility of changing conditions due to the importer's error is also reduced 

Smart contact can be exchanged within 24 hours by drastically reducing the period required for traditional document exchange from 5 to 10 days.
The speed and traceability of information:
Reduce administrative processing costs by avoiding time delays due to step-by-step paperwork processing and reducing the number of document exchanges: Simplify administrative processing.
Blockchain can prevent malicious long-term cargo by preventing false information and securing information reliability. : Preventing long-term congestion cargo cost.
To achieve friction-free processes, L/C, All parties’s data, payment process and shipping process’s networks must communicate with each other : interoperability.

Oneledger is a blockchain as a Service (Baas) options supplier founded by experts who worked for Fortune 500 executives and run by a Forbes executive member, partnered with IBM and Google cloud and more to attract the inteded customers like businesses, governments, and people to solve their most complex and essential challenges using the OneLedger blockchain technology and other disruptive technologies however, customers like supply chain and logistic, health care, real state, grants and contribution,banks and e-commerce will transform thier business challanges to managable profitabe process.
The size of oneledger intented customers is unknow due to the early stages of adaption and spesific use cases for business however, the market captalization is over two millions dollar. 

There are plenty of other cross chain projects. Many like Unibright and Cardstack are more focused on higher-level user issues and in integrating those with existing lower layers. There are others, such as Polkadot, ICON network and Wanchain that seek to be the dominant coin or blockchain. Many include features for businesses, however, OneLedger differs from all these by being a gateway, not the dominant solution.

OneLedger is a unique engine, not an adjunct of an existing platform.  Unlike other blockchain projects, OneLedger platform uses enhanced consensus DPoS which consistently replicates an application on many machines so OneLedger can combine different consensus, in the same chain OneLedger’s focus is not to be the master chain but to interact with others by offloading updates approved using OneLedger’s probability 1 Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus scheme to occur as state changes to OneLedger

Interoperability protocol for Ethereum and BTC and soon any chain (BSC, POLKA, MATIC, ETH etc.)
Can build public or private chain, side chain or off-chain and on-chain on either centralized or decentralized platform.
Thus we can provide customized blockchain solutions for business needs by building applications on top of their proprietary blockchain software with integrations into third-party chains, software systems and tools.
Oneledger development of dApps must be decentralized many other projects like overledger has to be centeralized.
with oneledger allowing complex business modules to span multiple chains OneLedger focus on ensuring that actions performed on different chains will be synchronized which provide high speed process, mermory management and reduced time consumsion.

There is high competention between blockchain technologies solution providers and what technology are using and how they are implemented them.
companies like Cosmos, Aio and Quant however, Oneleger taking unique approch differeciate how the protocol work, here some projects with different 
blockchain technology implementaion:

##### Cosmos (Tendermint):
Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent blockchains, which are connected through a shared communication protocol called the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm for validating transactions on the Cosmos network.
 
![hub_and_zones](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23088451/221544877-fc602c83-bbfa-4664-87ca-b8617dc98848.png)



At the basis, the Cosmos Hub manages many independent blockchains called “zones” (sometimes referred to as “shards”, in reference to the database scaling technique known as “sharding”). A constant stream of recent block commits from zones posted on the Hub allows the Hub to keep up with the state of each zone. Likewise, each zone keeps up with the state of the Hub (but zones do not keep up with each other except indirectly through the Hub). Packets of information are then communicated from one zone to another by posting Merkle-proofs as evidence that the information was sent and received. This mechanism is called inter-blockchain communication, or IBC for short.
Tendermint consensus algorithm:
The Cosmos Hub is the first public blockchain in the Cosmos Network, powered by the Tendermint BFT consensus algorithm. The Tendermint open-source project was born in 2014 to address the speed, scalability, and environmental issues of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus algorithm 
Tendermint team was the first to conceptually demonstrate a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency that addresses the nothing-at-stake problem suffered by first-generation proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies such as NXT and BitShares1.0.Tendermint is designed to never fork at all,

- The Hub:
Cosmos Hub is a blockchain that hosts a multi-asset distributed ledger, where tokens can be held by individual users or by zones themselves. These  tokens  can be moved from one zone to another in a special IBC packet called a “coin packet”. The hub is responsible for preserving the global invariance of the total amount of each token across the zones. IBC coin packet transactions must be committed by the sender, hub, and receiver blockchains.
Cosmos Hub acts as the central ledger for the whole system, the security of the Hub is of paramount importance. While each zone may be a Tendermint blockchain that is secured by as few as 4 (or even less if BFT consensus is not needed), the Hub must be secured by a globally decentralized set of validators that can withstand the most severe attack scenarios, such as a continental network partition or a nation-state sponsored attack.

- Zones:
A Cosmos zone is an independent blockchain that exchanges IBC messages with the Hub. From the Hub’s perspective, a zone is a multi-asset dynamic-membership multi-signature account that can send and receive tokens using IBC packets. Like a cryptocurrency account, a zone cannot transfer more tokens than it has, but can receive tokens from others who have them. A zone may be designated as an “source” of one or more token types, granting it the power to inflate that token supply. Atoms of the Cosmos Hub may be staked by validators of a zone connected to the Hub. While double-spend attacks on these zones would result in the slashing of atoms with Tendermint’s fork-accountability, a zone where >⅔ of the voting power are Byzantine can commit invalid state. The Cosmos Hub does not verify or execute transactions committed on other zones, so it is the responsibility of users to send tokens to zones that they trust.

- Inter-blockchain Communication (IBC):
Now we look at how the Hub and zones communicate with each other. For example, if there are three blockchains, “Zone1”, “Zone2”, and “Hub”, and we wish for “Zone1” to produce a packet destined for “Zone2” going through “Hub”. To move a packet from one blockchain to another, a proof is posted on the receiving chain. The proof states that the sending chain published a packet for the alleged destination. For the receiving chain to check this proof, it must be able keep up with the sender’s block headers. This mechanism is similar to that used by sidechains, which requires two interacting chains to be aware of one another via a bidirectional stream of proof-of-existence datagrams (transactions).

The IBC protocol can naturally be defined using two types of transactions: an IBCBlockCommitTx transaction, which allows a blockchain to prove to any observer of its most recent block-hash, and an IBCPacketTx transaction, which allows a blockchain to prove to any observer that the given packet was indeed published by the sender’s application, via a Merkle-proof to the recent block-hash.

By splitting the IBC mechanics into two separate transactions, we allow the native fee market-mechanism of the receiving chain to determine which packets get committed (i.e. acknowledged), while allowing for complete freedom on the sending chain as to how many outbound packets are allowed.

![Cosom IBC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23088451/221551477-83ced5aa-ff9e-46fc-8db4-768548bd1f87.png)

In the example above, in order to update the block-hash of “Zone1” on “Hub” (or of “Hub” on “Zone2”), an IBCBlockCommitTx transaction must be posted on “Hub” with the block-hash of “Zone1” (or on “Zone2” with the block-hash of “Hub”).


##### Aion (Nuco):

Aion is a third-generation blockchain network that will enable any private or public sector organization to:
• Federate:Send data and value between any Aion-compliant blockchain and Ethereum.
• Scale:Provide fast transaction processing and increased data capacity to all Aionb lockchains.
• Spoke: Allow the creation of customized public or private blockchains that maintain interoperability with other blockchains, but
allow publishers to choose governance, consensus mechanisms, issuance, and participation
Aion is a third generation design, whose hub and spoke model is focused on scaling and reliability. It easily connects public and private blockchains but explicitly requires that they integrate its protocol and it uses Aion Virtual Machine (AVM) which allow for the transfer of assets and data between different blockchain networks. 
Aion also uses a unique consensus algorithm called "Proof of Intelligence (PoI)", which combines PoS and game theory to incentivize validators to act in the best interest of the network.
AION does is basically act as a central hub for participating networks. You can transfer data from one blockchain to another by passing over the AION blockchain. The multi-tier network of AION consists of 4 basic components:

<img width="941" alt="Aion Network" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23088451/221577305-b704487e-0074-4515-b0a1-eeafdead6cbd.png">

  - Connecting Network
  - Interchain transactions
  - Bridges
  - Participating networks
  - Connecting Network 

- Connecting Network:
is the protocol that provides communication between participating blockchains. Both Private and Public Chains are allowed to communicate with each other. 
The bridging protocol allows routing of messages between participating blockchains. The connecting bridge might have been a centralized entity, but AION replaces it with its own blockchain. Thus providing full decentralized accountability.
The connecting network also makes sure the correctness of data, smooth flow of data, makes sure no data is lost in transaction, and manage difficulties in transactions.
- Interchain transactions
AION connects different blockchains and makes what we call an amalgamation of blockchain or an interconnected system. 
The source blockchain initiates the interchain transactions. It then flows through the bridge and the connecting networks to the targeted blockchain. All of this might seem confusing. Let us understand how it works with an example.
The source chain A initiates an interchain transaction
The transaction flows through the bridge and connecting network.
The transaction reaches the targeted blockchain B and successfully transfers data between them.
Each interchain transaction has some basic components:
Payload: The actual data users intend to send from one chain to another.
Metadata: This contains the information regarding routing and fees associated with it.
Merkle proof: This is an optional step, and users can use this step to bypass the connecting bridge.
- Bridges:
Bridges are the validators who validate interchain transactions	when a bridge validator observes an interchain transaction, then the state is changed to   receive.
The validators then sign and broadcast the transactions as valid after the forwarding fees are paid. After receiving two-thirds of the votes from validators, the state changes to On Hold.
Additionally, the connected blockchain token will be locked and kept on hold till the transaction is completed.
Suppose the transaction gets less than two-thirds of the vote. Then the transaction state changes to Rejectedand eventually changes to Finalized.
After the On Hold state, the transactions are then forwarded to the connecting network.
When the target blockchain sends a confirmation, the state is changed to Confirmed and then to Finalized.
After a Finalized report is shown, all the fees are distributed to the connecting network and bridge validators.
- Participating Network:
The AION ecosystem has some guidelines that need to be fulfilled if any network wants to be a part of it. When a network passes the criteria, then they are called participating networks. There is flexibility in what or who can be a part of the AION ecosystem, and it is not only limited to blockchain entities.
Even oracles, cryptlets, or database clusters can participate if they follow the requirements. The requirements are:
The most obvious thing is, the participating network should be decentralized. 
Should be able to differentiate between regular and interchain transactions.
Familiar with consensus protocol used by the bridge and storing valid transactions.
Should have the ability to freeze up transactions when the state is On-Hold.
 
These technologies are all competing to bind together the existing chains into a massive single entity. What makes OneLedger different is not trying to sit over the other chains, but rather interested in bridging that decentralized ecosystem with the existing centralized enterprise space.


## Landscape
OneLedger's blockchain platform can be used to develop various types of applications, such as cross-border payments, supply chain finance, asset tracking and management, and other financial services that require secure and efficient transaction processing, Morever comapnies like Ripple, Chain, Stellar, Ethereum, ConsenSys are very competitive in finance and are investing away more in makrketing and development.
Over the last 5-10 years There is trends and innovations of the finannce sector and how blockchaing technology will shift the old finannce for example 
Cross-border payments:
Increased adoption of digital payment platforms and mobile wallets for cross-border transactions, emergence of blockchain-based solutions for cross-border payments, offering faster, more secure, and lower-cost alternatives to traditional methods.
Supply chain finance:
Increased use of technology, such as blockchain, IoT, and AI, to automate and streamline supply chain processes
Emergence of supply chain finance platforms, enabling suppliers to access funding based on their outstanding invoices and reducing reliance on traditional bank financing
Greater focus on sustainability and responsible supply chain practices, leading to the development of ESG-focused supply chain finance solutions
Asset tracking and management:
Increased adoption of IoT and blockchain-based solutions for asset tracking, enabling more efficient and secure tracking of assets across supply chains and reducing the risk of fraud and theft
Greater focus on data analytics and AI for asset management, enabling more accurate forecasting and predictive maintenance
Emergence of tokenization and fractional ownership models for assets, enabling wider access to investment opportunities and greater liquidity in asset markets
Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies.

## Results
OneLedger is founded five years ago and its business impact is still growing never the less with covid-19 onledger has provided 
OnePass soloution for organizations the tools to verify the health status(Covid 19 vaccine tracking/Test results) of people entering their establishments through secure, private and assurance compliant solution.
Morever,always be private for these institutions, which means they require a way to intercommunicate across these institutions National Australia Bank (NAB). NAB was trying to connect assets off their balance sheet with a Singapore based bank and was failing OneLedger solved this problem, by bringing institutions like NAB into DeFi. 

blockchain technology is new era and it distrub the old inefficient system fintech comapny have differcess of how blockchain technologies model to be implemenated. 
key preformance indicaters like adoption rate, ravenue, customer satisfacetion, operational effeciencey and market share, however to access these information inside data need to be revelaed.
OneLedger is growing by keep adding new partenars like Moonba the first decentralized exchange (DEX), google cloud and more which will attract more customers and increase revenue, moreever, it will accelerate the adoption rate over .


## Recommendations

Since blockchain technology is on its early stages of adoption and massive increasing of data voloume everyday will lead to scalablbilty problem at 
some point, Morever, with all other compiters awarness of the problem oneleger need to consider and scal up thier model.

hybird smart contract which is intrduced by ChainLink would be prefect soultion for oneledger to over come scalabilty future problem.
developers need to keep developing oneledger platform competively also the makrketing in sports sector will benfit the company.

Hybrid smart contracts are  meta contracts. Meta contracts are applications coded on a decentralized metalayer and implicitly encompass on-chain logic (smart contracts), as well as off- chain computation and connectivity among various blockchains and existing off-chain services. Given the need for language and compiler support, new security models, and conceptual and technical harmonization of disparate technologies, however, realization of a true decentralized metalayer is an ambitious goal to which we aspire over a long time horizon. 
Decentralized Oracle Networks, or DONs it acts as a powerful abstraction layer, offering interfaces for smart contracts to extensive off-chain resources and highly efficient yet decentralized off-chain computing resources within the DON itself.
