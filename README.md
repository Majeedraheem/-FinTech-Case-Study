#  OneLedger Case Study 

## Overview and Origin. 

Blockchain technology is revolutionary innovative concept that uses distributed ledgers, cryptography and smart contracts to tackle and deliver secured quality products that will change the prespective of what online services preforms, however, the single aspect we know is yet to come an old fashion blockchain is game changer of how internet is operating.
The global data is increasing rapidly, therefore, privacy and security are challanging to maintain specially in finance sector where the most needed.
Financial technology known as (Fintech) companies are here to solve these challanges by Appling blockchain technologies to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services.

#About The Company:#

Oneledger founded on 2017 located in Toronto Canada by, David Cao is the Founder of OneLedger who has over 3 years of blockchain experience and over 10 years of enterprise architect experience,worked at IBM Toronto Lab on the development of DB2 and WebSphere Commerce core engine. As a specialist in supply chain, payments, e-commerce  David has helped large enterprises grow exponentially, including Home Depot, Sears, and Toshiba. David is an active member in both the Hyperledger and blockchain community.

Edwin Zhang Co-founder & Managing Director Edwin is a veteran in the blockchain startup and investment space. He is a former Software Engineering Lead spearheading blockchain-related R&D for TribalScale – an innovation firm specializing in emerging technologies
Edwin has a vast technical background as both a blockchain developer, with Solidity and Ethereum smart contract development experience, and software developer. He brings to the table extensive investment experience backed by a technical foundation, and a wide global reach within the cryptocurrency community.

Fund was raised with over eight companies invisters like Coinbar, Signal Ventures,LCG Ventures,Blockground Capital they all beleived in Oneledger as recelntly Coinex joined invisters whom have disclosed invistement.

Currently blockchains exist as isolated networks introducing two major restrictions, among others:
No practical way to transfer value directly between different blockchains. Today, if we want to transfer digital assets ‘across’ chains, we          have to do so by transferring the assets to intermediary centralized exchanges, using their in-house wallets and ledgers to swap assets, and then transferring the new assets to their corresponding blockchains. This process is, of course, time consuming, costly and involves substantial third-party risks. Cross-chain atomic swaps, where digital assets can be moved across different blockchains without the need to trust a third-party, are being worked on, but are still far from being ready for widespread adoption.

Inability of businesses and individuals to easily deploy distributed applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain platforms. Today, to deploy dApps across multiple platforms, developers need to write smart contracts in multiple languages, depending on each platform of choice. This is, again, expensive, resource-intensive, and time-consuming, thereby making dApps practically infeasible, and largely ineffective for businesses.
These two major restrications need to be tackle OneLedger has taken a uniquely interesting route to making blockchains interoperable and here  OneLedger (OLT) is a platform that helps businesses to adapt to blockchain technology in a fast and simplified manner. 
For enterprises, Developers, investors. OneLedger provide a true universal protocol that provides a one-stop solution for enterprise blockchain applications in the form of modules. 
The smart contract built on OneLedger Protocol is a true cross-chain smart contract.The OneLedger plans to create a platform where multiple blockchains can interact with each other through the platform’s chain.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

There are a number of projects, such as Cosmos, Polkadot, Aion and Overledger, that are currently working on different aspects of blockchain interoperability, each proposing different mechanisms and solutions to facilitate cross-ledger operations.

OneLedger (OLT) is a platform that helps businesses to adapt to blockchain technology in a fast and simplified manner. The OneLedger plans to create a platform where multiple blockchains can interact with each other through the platform’s chain. 

The platform uses delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) that continuously replicates an application on many machines to combine different consensus in the same chain. 
The communication between multiple blockchains is faster with a lower transaction fee. 
The platform helps businesses create a customized blockchain solution. According to its whitepaper, the platform aims to develop a blockchain-based platform that allows businesses to integrate their applications and products.
The protocol shows compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. It offers faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum and is more stable. The DPoS feature used in the protocol ensures four thousand transactions per second (TPS), making the protocol highly efficient. The smart contracts ensure that protocol runs on low data across the network, hence, low transaction fees. Smart contracts are just like regular contracts however, instead of being drafted on paper, these contracts run in the form of protocols on the blockchain. The platform invites more developers to create decentralized apps (Dapps) using OneLedger’s virtual machine.
OLT is the native token of the OneLedger platform that complies with ERC-20 token standards. The users can utilize OLT to pay the network fees within the platform. The users can trade OLT tokens from other token holders or become a node (a computer server connected with the network) to acquire tokens themselves. If a user chooses to become a node, they have to stake OLT tokens after a period of commitment and quality.
Developers need OLT tokens if they want to deploy their module to the platform. The developers submit their module and OLT tokens to the marketplace. The most relevant module receives 25 percent of the tokens reserved for the community.
