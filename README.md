# OneLedger Case Study 


## Overview and Origin 

Blockchain technology is a revolutionary and innovative concept that uses distributed ledgers, cryptography, and smart contracts to deliver secure, high-quality products that will change the perspective of how online services perform. However, the single aspect we know is yet to come, an old-fashioned blockchain is a game-changer for how the internet operates.

Global data is increasing rapidly; therefore, privacy and security are challenging to maintain, especially in the finance sector, where they are most needed. Financial technology, known as Fintech, companies are here to solve these challenges by applying blockchain technologies to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services.

### About the Company:
OneLedger was founded in 2017 and is located in Toronto, Canada. David Cao is the Founder of OneLedger, who has over three years of blockchain experience and over 10 years of enterprise architect experience. He worked at IBM Toronto Lab on the development of DB2 and WebSphere Commerce core engine. As a specialist in supply chain, payments, and e-commerce, David has helped large enterprises grow exponentially, including Home Depot, Sears, and Toshiba. David is an active member of both the Hyperledger and blockchain community.

Edwin Zhang is the Co-founder and Managing Director of OneLedger. He is a veteran in the blockchain startup and investment space, and a former Software Engineering Lead spearheading blockchain-related R&D for TribalScale - an innovation firm specializing in emerging technologies. Edwin has a vast technical background as both a blockchain developer, with Solidity and Ethereum smart contract development experience, and software developer. He brings to the table extensive investment experience backed by a technical foundation and a wide global reach within the cryptocurrency community.

Funds were raised with over eight companies investors, like Coinbar, Signal Ventures, LCG Ventures, and Blockground Capital, who all believed in OneLedger. Recently, Coinex joined investors who all have disclosed investment funds.

Currently, blockchains exist as isolated networks introducing two major restrictions, among others:

No practical way to transfer value directly between different blockchains. Today, if we want to transfer digital assets 'across' chains, we have to do so by transferring the assets to intermediary centralized exchanges, using their in-house wallets and ledgers to swap assets, and then transferring the new assets to their corresponding blockchains. This process is, of course, time-consuming, costly, and involves substantial third-party risks. Cross-chain atomic swaps, where digital assets can be moved across different blockchains without the need to trust a third-party, are being worked on, but are still far from being ready for widespread adoption.
Inability of businesses and individuals to easily deploy distributed applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain platforms. Today, to deploy dApps across multiple platforms, developers need to write smart contracts in multiple languages, depending on each platform of choice. This is, again, expensive, resource-intensive, and time-consuming, thereby making dApps practically infeasible and largely ineffective for businesses.
These two major restrictions need to be tackled. OneLedger has taken a uniquely interesting route to making blockchains interoperable, and here, OneLedger (OLT) is a platform that helps businesses adapt to blockchain technology in a fast and simplified manner. For enterprises, developers, and investors, OneLedger provides a true universal protocol that provides a one-stop solution for enterprise blockchain applications in the form of modules. The smart contract built on the OneLedger Protocol is a true cross-chain smart contract. The OneLedger plans to create a platform where multiple blockchains can interact with each other through the platform's chain.


## Business Activities:

As blockchain technologies continue to evolve, OneLedger’s expertise in implementing blockchain in advisory banks, trade and the L/C system create opportunities to grow businesses by overcoming the industry’s significant challenges.

How does a letter of credit work?

![Business activity ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23088451/220787800-d381aa42-ebe3-44e6-8733-9be162e10285.png)



Trade is transactions between trading parties in different countries, with the flow of goods and documents separated. In particular, Letter of Credit, the economic guarantee from a creditworthy bank to an exporter of goods, plays a vital role in settling trade payments.

##### Current letter of credit system challenges:

However, disputes arise due to delays in delivering goods, processing bills, receiving goods, and inconsistencies of the relevant documents.

Trading parties and international organisations have gone to great lengths to address these problems. In particular, bank intervention as a broker of transactions has helped solve trade-related issues. Still, the resulting increase in transaction costs, complex procedures, and paper-based trading practices can hinder trade development. This is because paper documents are bulky in the process. For example, it takes more than five business days to deliver paper documents.
Other raised issue is that If the exporter presents documents that do not meet the conditions of the letter of credit, the payment cannot be collected. The importer has a limitation that the quality of the goods is not guaranteed even if the documents match.
Credit risk arising from trade transactions and the cost of complicated procedures are factors that increase barriers to entry into international trade.

The solution to these challenges:
Letter of credit using blockchain will bring to businesses: transaction-related costs can be significantly reduced because they are not subject to central control and resolve obstacles to current L/C transactions and prevent fraud.
Letter of credit and all data can store on all parties networks, which can’t be tampered with and verified simultaneously: immutability.
L/C will be created as NFT on Smart contract and when there is a new transaction, parties certify the transaction in real-time: security and confidentiality.
Exporters can monitor the importer's L/C application process on the blockchain. Therefore, the possibility of changing conditions due to the importer's error is also reduced 

Smart contact can be exchanged within 24 hours by drastically reducing the period required for traditional document exchange from 5 to 10 days.
The speed and traceability of information:
Reduce administrative processing costs by avoiding time delays due to step-by-step paperwork processing and reducing the number of document exchanges: Simplify administrative processing.
Blockchain can prevent malicious long-term cargo by preventing false information and securing information reliability. : Preventing long-term congestion cargo cost.
To achieve friction-free processes, L/C, All parties’s data, payment process and shipping process’s networks must communicate with each other : interoperability.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Oneledger is a blockchain as a Service (Baas) options supplier founded by experts who worked for Fortune 500 executives and run by a Forbes executive member, partnered with IBM and Google cloud. 
inteded customers in this space are businesses, governments, and people solve their most complex and essential challenges using the OneLedger blockchain technology and other disruptive technologies however, customers like supply chain and logistic, health care, real state, grants and contribution,banks and e-commerce.
the size of oneledger intented customers is unknow due to the technology is on the early stages of adaption and spesific use cases for business.
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

There are plenty of other cross chain projects. Many like Unibright and Cardstack are more focused on higher-level user issues and in integrating those with existing lower layers. There are others, such as Polkadot, ICON network and Wanchain that seek to be the dominant coin or blockchain. Many include features for businesses, but OneLedger differs from all these by being a gateway, not the dominant solution.
OneLedger is a unique engine, not an adjunct of an existing platform.  Unlike other blockchain projects, OneLedger platform uses enhanced consensus DPoS on Tendermint which consistently replicates an application on many machines so OneLedger can combine different consensus in the same chain.
Deploy customizable private/public sidechains that will communicate with each other interoperable with the main chain.
Ultrafast deployment with low transaction costs.
Interoperability protocol for Ethereum and BTC and soon any chain (BSC, POLKA, MATIC, ETH etc.)
Can build public or private chain, side chain or off-chain and on-chain on either centralized or decentralized platform.
Thus we can provide customized blockchain solutions for business needs by building applications on top of their proprietary blockchain software with integrations into third-party chains, software systems and tools.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
There is high competention between blockchain technologies solution providers like Cosmos, Aio and Quant however, Oneleger taking unique approch differentiate how the proctol work 

- Cosmos (Tendermint):
Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent blockchains, which are connected through a shared communication protocol called     the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm for validating transactions on the Cosmos network. 
It achieves this by using a set of validators to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain network. 
Validators are selected based on their stake in the network and their performance history.
Cosmos will let tokens flow from one chain to another, OneLedger will focus on ensuring that actions performed on different chains will be synchronized.

- Aion (Nuco):
Aion is a third generation design, whose hub and spoke model is focused on scaling and reliability. It easily connects public and private blockchains but explicitly requires that they integrate its protocol and it uses Aion Virtual Machine (AVM) which allow for the transfer of assets and data between different blockchain networks. 
Aion also uses a unique consensus algorithm called "Proof of Intelligence (PoI)", which combines PoS and game theory to incentivize validators to act in the best interest of the network.
For general scalability, we’ll support multi-party side-chains, but we also expect that the demands of industries like finance will always mean that a large number of chains will continue to exist. 
Easy and consistent access across all of them will be necessary. Unlike Aion, 


- Quant:
OverLedger seeks to provide an operating system for blockchains, with the aim of enabling dApp portability within the decentralized realm.
OneLedger seeks to build the dApps on the centralized side, so that they can be tested in a controlled environment, then deployed and synchronized across the blockchain space.
OneLedger allows Master Smart Contracts that can be transpiled and deployed across the ecosystem. While this may seem similar to dApp portability, OneLedger seeks to build up the capabilities as Business Modules on the centralized side that provide usable primitives in the decentralized side. This layered architecture enables a framework that can grow in sophistication as the technologies mature. As well, it simplifies the mechanics and reduces testing. While the deployment of dApps on both platforms is obviously decentralized, on OverLedger the development of dApps must be decentralized while on OneLedger it does not have to be.


These technologies are all competing to bind together the existing chains into a massive single entity. What makes OneLedger different is that we are not trying to sit over the other chains, but rather we are interested in bridging that decentralized ecosystem with the existing centralized enterprise space.

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
OneLedger is founded five years ago and its business impact is still growing never the less with covid-19 onledger has provided 
OnePass soloution that provides organizations the tools to verify the health status(Covid 19 vaccine tracking/Test results) of people entering their establishments through secure, private and assurance compliant solution.
Morever,always be private for these institutions, which means they require a way to intercommunicate across these institutions National Australia Bank (NAB). NAB was trying to connect assets off their balance sheet with a Singapore based bank and was failing OneLedger solved this problem, by bringing institutions like NAB into DeFi. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
blockchain technology is new era and it distrub the old uneffecient system fintech comapny have differces of how blockchain technologies model to me implemenated many there is many key preformance indicaters like adoption rate, ravenue, customer satisfacetion, operational effeciencey and market share and to access these information inside data need to be revelaed ,however, OneLedger is growing to add new partenars like Moonba the first decentralized exchange (DEX), google cloud and more which will attract more customers 




* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? 

Overall, both algorithms have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Tendermint's focus on fast and secure consensus may be particularly well-suited for the interoperability-focused Cosmos network, while OneLedger's PoS algorithm may be more suitable for enterprise blockchain applications that require scalability, interoperability, and high levels of security. Ultimately, the choice of algorithm depends on the specific use case and requirements of the blockchain application in question.
