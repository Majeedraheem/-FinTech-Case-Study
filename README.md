#  OneLedger Case Study 

## Overview and Origin. 

Blockchain technology is revolutionary innovative concept that uses distributed ledgers, cryptography and smart contracts to tackle and deliver secured quality products that will change the prespective of what online services preforms, however, the single aspect we know is yet to come an old fashion blockchain is game changer of how internet is operating.
The global data is increasing rapidly, therefore, privacy and security are challanging to maintain specially in finance sector where the most needed.
Financial technology known as (Fintech) companies are here to solve these challanges by Appling blockchain technologies to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services.

Edwin has a vast technical background as both a blockchain developer, with Solidity and Ethereum smart contract development experience, and software developer. He brings to the table extensive investment experience backed by a technical foundation, and a wide global reach within the cryptocurrency community.

Fund was raised with over eight companies invisters like Coinbar, Signal Ventures,LCG Ventures,Blockground Capital they all beleived in Oneledger as recelntly Coinex joined invisters whom have disclosed invistement.

Currently blockchains exist as isolated networks introducing two major restrictions, among others:

No practical way to transfer value directly between different blockchains. Today, if we want to transfer digital assets ‘across’ chains, we          have to do so by transferring the assets to intermediary centralized exchanges, using their in-house wallets and ledgers to swap assets, and then transferring the new assets to their corresponding blockchains. This process is, of course, time consuming, costly and involves substantial third-party risks. Cross-chain atomic swaps, where digital assets can be moved across different blockchains without the need to trust a third-party, are being worked on, but are still far from being ready for widespread adoption.

Inability of businesses and individuals to easily deploy distributed applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain platforms. Today, to deploy dApps across multiple platforms, developers need to write smart contracts in multiple languages, depending on each platform of choice. This is, again, expensive, resource-intensive, and time-consuming, thereby making dApps practically infeasible, and largely ineffective for businesses.

These two major restrictions need to be tackle OneLedger has taken a uniquely interesting route to making blockchains interoperable and here  OneLedger (OLT) is a platform that helps businesses to adapt to blockchain technology in a fast and simplified manner. 
For enterprises, Developers, investors. OneLedger provide a true universal protocol that provides a one-stop solution for enterprise blockchain applications in the form of modules. 
The smart contract built on OneLedger Protocol is a true cross-chain smart contract.The OneLedger plans to create a platform where multiple blockchains can interact with each other through the platform’s chain.

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?


Letter of Credit automation and management

As blockchain technologies continue to evolve, OneLedger’s expertise in implementing blockchain in advisory banks, trade and the L/C system create opportunities to grow businesses by overcoming the industry’s significant challenges.

![Business activity ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23088451/220785878-d5ba4cd0-1334-42d5-9b34-54efff222154.png)




How does a letter of credit work?

Trade is transactions between trading parties in different countries, with the flow of goods and documents separated. In particular, Letter of Credit, the economic guarantee from a creditworthy bank to an exporter of goods, plays a vital role in settling trade payments.

Current letter of credit system challenges

However, disputes arise due to delays in delivering goods, processing bills, receiving goods, and inconsistencies of the relevant documents.

Trading parties and international organisations have gone to great lengths to address these problems. In particular, bank intervention as a broker of transactions has helped solve trade-related issues. Still, the resulting increase in transaction costs, complex procedures, and paper-based trading practices can hinder trade development. This is because paper documents are bulky in the process. For example, it takes more than five business days to deliver paper documents.

Other raised issue is that If the exporter presents documents that do not meet the conditions of the letter of credit, the payment cannot be collected. The importer has a limitation that the quality of the goods is not guaranteed even if the documents match.

Credit risk arising from trade transactions and the cost of complicated procedures are factors that increase barriers to entry into international trade.

Our solution to these challenges

Letter of credit using blockchain will bring to businesses: transaction-related costs can be significantly reduced because they are not subject to central control and resolve obstacles to current L/C transactions and prevent fraud.
Letter of credit and all data can store on all parties networks, which can’t be tampered with and verified simultaneously: immutability.
L/C will be created as NFT on Smart contract and when there is a new transaction, parties certify the transaction in real-time: security and confidentiality.
Exporters can monitor the importer's L/C application process on the blockchain. Therefore, the possibility of changing conditions due to the importer's error is also reduced. : Transparency of documents and transactions.
Smart contact can be exchanged within 24 hours by drastically reducing the period required for traditional document exchange from 5 to 10 days. : The speed and traceability of information.
Reduce administrative processing costs by avoiding time delays due to step-by-step paperwork processing and reducing the number of document exchanges: Simplify administrative processing.
Blockchain can prevent malicious long-term cargo by preventing false information and securing information reliability. : Preventing long-term congestion cargo cost.
To achieve friction-free processes, L/C, All parties’s data, payment process and shipping process’s networks must communicate with each other : interoperability

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

There are a number of projects, such as Cosmos, Polkadot, Aion and Overledger, that are currently working on different aspects of blockchain interoperability, each proposing different mechanisms and solutions to facilitate cross-ledger operations.

OneLedger (OLT) is a platform that helps businesses to adapt to blockchain technology in a fast and simplified manner. The OneLedger plans to create a platform where multiple blockchains can interact with each other through the platform’s chain. 

The platform uses delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) that continuously replicates an application on many machines to combine different consensus in the same chain. 
The communication between multiple blockchains is faster with a lower transaction fee. 
The platform helps businesses create a customized blockchain solution. According to its whitepaper, the platform aims to develop a blockchain-based platform that allows businesses to integrate their applications and products.
The protocol shows compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. It offers faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum and is more stable. The DPoS feature used in the protocol ensures four thousand transactions per second (TPS), making the protocol highly efficient. The smart contracts ensure that protocol runs on low data across the network, hence, low transaction fees. Smart contracts are just like regular contracts however, instead of being drafted on paper, these contracts run in the form of protocols on the blockchain. The platform invites more developers to create decentralized apps (Dapps) using OneLedger’s virtual machine.
OLT is the native token of the OneLedger platform that complies with ERC-20 token standards. The users can utilize OLT to pay the network fees within the platform. The users can trade OLT tokens from other token holders or become a node (a computer server connected with the network) to acquire tokens themselves. If a user chooses to become a node, they have to stake OLT tokens after a period of commitment and quality.
Developers need OLT tokens if they want to deploy their module to the platform. The developers submit their module and OLT tokens to the marketplace. The most relevant module receives 25 percent of the tokens reserved for the community.
