OneLedger (OLT) is a platform that helps businesses to adapt to blockchain technology in a fast and simplified manner. The OneLedger plans to create a platform where multiple blockchains can interact with each other through the platform’s chain. The platform uses delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) that continuously replicates an application on many machines to combine different consensus in the same chain. 
The communication between multiple blockchains is faster with a lower transaction fee. 
The platform helps businesses create a customized blockchain solution. According to its whitepaper, the platform aims to develop a blockchain-based platform that allows businesses to integrate their applications and products.
The protocol shows compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. It offers faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum and is more stable. The DPoS feature used in the protocol ensures four thousand transactions per second (TPS), making the protocol highly efficient. The smart contracts ensure that protocol runs on low data across the network, hence, low transaction fees. Smart contracts are just like regular contracts however, instead of being drafted on paper, these contracts run in the form of protocols on the blockchain. The platform invites more developers to create decentralized apps (Dapps) using OneLedger’s virtual machine.
OLT is the native token of the OneLedger platform that complies with ERC-20 token standards. The users can utilize OLT to pay the network fees within the platform. The users can trade OLT tokens from other token holders or become a node (a computer server connected with the network) to acquire tokens themselves. If a user chooses to become a node, they have to stake OLT tokens after a period of commitment and quality.
Developers need OLT tokens if they want to deploy their module to the platform. The developers submit their module and OLT tokens to the marketplace. The most relevant module receives 25 percent of the tokens reserved for the community.
